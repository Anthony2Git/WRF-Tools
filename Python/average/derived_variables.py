'''
Created on 2013-10-01

A module defining a base class and some instances, which provide a mechanism to add derived/secondary variables
to WRF monthly means generated with the wrfout_average module.
The DerivedVariable instances are imported by wrfout_average and its methods are executed at the appropriate 
points during the averaging process.

    Instances of this class are imported by wrfout_average; it defines methods that the averaging script uses,
    to create the NetCDF variable and compute the values for a given derived variable.
    This is the base class and variable creation etc. is defined here.
    Computation of the values has to be defined in the appropriate child classes, as it depends on the variable.
