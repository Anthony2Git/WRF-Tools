# # ccsm_launch is a "hybrid program launcher" for MPI-OpenMP programs
# # poe reads from a commands file, where each MPI task is launched
# # with ccsm_launch, which takes care of the processor affinity for the
# # OpenMP threads.  Each line in the poe.cmdfile reads something like:
# #        ccsm_launch ./myCPMD
# # and there must be as many such lines as MPI tasks.  The number of MPI
# # tasks must match the task_geometry statement describing the process placement
# # on the nodes.
