## run configuration (otherwise set in queue settings)
export WPSNODES=1 # the devel node
export TASKS=4 # number of MPI task per node (Hpyerthreading?)
# N.B.: TASKS could be more, but since they run on the devel node, 
#       we don't want to overload the system
export THREADS=1 # number of OpenMP threads

## job settings
# get PBS names (needed for folder names)
export JOBNAME='cycling_WPS' # job name (dummy variable, since there is no queue)
export INIDIR="${PWD}" # experiment root (launch directory)
# directory setup
export WPSSCRIPT="run_cycling_WPS.sh" # WRF suffix assumed, WPS suffix substituted: ${JOBNAME%_WRF}_WPS
# WRF and WPS wallclock  time limits (no way to query from queue system)
export WRFWCT='24:00:00' # WRF wallclock time limit
export WPSWCT='01:00:00' # WPS wallclock time limit
